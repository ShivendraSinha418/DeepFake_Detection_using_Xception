This repository contains the implementation of Xception model for the deepfake detection of GAN generated images by means of fine tunning  the Xception model trained on Imagenet dataset. This repository contains the notebooks that illustrate the model building along with the links to the pretrained models.
The dataset for this model contains Fake images (35000) which constitutes the images generated by various GAN architectrues and the Real images(35000) from the celebA dataset.
Moreover the model trained on the Real and Fake image classification is further tuned for the multiclass classification problem for determining which GAN architecture has been used for generating a given fake image.
